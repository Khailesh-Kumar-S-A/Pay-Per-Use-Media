# Pay-Per-Use-Media
# Pay-Per-Use Media Platform

This is a decentralized platform for media consumption where users can pay for individual pieces of content using Ethereum or Bitcoin. The platform uses blockchain and smart contracts to ensure secure, transparent, and seamless transactions.

## Features
- **Pay-Per-Use:** Users can pay for a single piece of content (e.g., a movie, song, or game) without needing a subscription.
- **Smart Contract Automation:** Payments are processed automatically using Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Transparent Transactions:** All payments and content access are logged on the blockchain for transparency and security.

## How It Works
1. **Content Providers:** Upload their media and set pricing for individual content.
2. **Users:** Choose content they want to view, make payments via Ethereum (or Bitcoin), and access the media instantly.
3. **Smart Contracts:** Handle payments and verify content access automatically once payment is completed.
